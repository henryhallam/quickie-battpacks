BMS head node functions:
- Communicate with 9 stacked LTC6804s
- Independently measure battery current and voltage
- Estimate state of charge
- Balancing
- 2x precharge outputs
- 2x contactors
- isoCAN to SiCtrollers and pilot interface
- At least 2 of:
 - Self-powered from HV
 - Iso DC-DC from LV bus
 - Backup battery
- Low-discharge standby mode, target < 200 uA (10% dischg in 6 months)
- Discrete I/O: Status LED and contactor override (open/auto/close)
Maybe:
- Blown fuse detection?
- Pyrofuse
